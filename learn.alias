# Learning Proficiency Alias
# This alias automates the tracking of proficiency learning progress using Avrae's downtime system.
#
# Usage:
# - Run this command while learning a proficiency (e.g., `!learn Smith's Tools`).
# - It tracks weekly progress and deducts available downtime weeks.
# - If the proficiency name is not typed exactly the same each time, progress may be lost.
#
# Features:
# - Creates a counter for the proficiency being learned, if not already existing.
# - Deducts one week from the characterâ€™s available downtime.
# - Updates and displays the remaining downtime and learning progress.
#
# Notes:
# - The number of weeks required is **10 minus the Intelligence modifier**.
# - Players should **use the same wording** each time they run the alias to avoid resetting progress.
# - If downtime weeks reach zero, learning cannot progress further until more downtime is available.
