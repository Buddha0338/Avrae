# Death Counter Alias
# This alias tracks the number of times a character has died in Avrae.
#
# Usage:
# - Run this command upon character death to update the death counter.
# - Tracks the number of deaths and applies penalties upon revival.
# - Introduces the "One Foot in the Grave" condition, which reduces healing effectiveness.
#
# Features:
# - **Death Counter:** Increments by 1 every time the character dies.
# - **Resurrection Costs:** The cost of resurrection spells increases based on the number of deaths.
# - **One Foot in the Grave:** Applies a penalty to healing after revival, requiring downtime to remove.
# - **Revival DC Scaling:** The DC to be revived increases with the number of deaths.
#
# Notes:
# - **All resurrection costs multiply by the number of deaths** (gold, diamonds, etc.).
# - **Healing received is halved** unless coming from a Long Rest.
# - **The "One Foot in the Grave" effect can be removed** by spending downtime equal to its value.
# - **Revival DC increases using the formula:**  
#   - **Base DC = 5 + ((2 Ã— Deaths) - 2)**
# - The alias automatically **creates and tracks counters** for both "Death Counter" and "One Foot in the Grave."
