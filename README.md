# Avrae Custom Aliases

This repository contains a collection of custom aliases designed for **Avrae**, a Discord bot used to automate Dungeons & Dragons gameplay. These scripts streamline common game mechanics, making it easier for players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) to track rolls, initiative, and other in-game actions.

## What is Avrae?
Avrae is a powerful Discord bot that integrates with D&D Beyond, allowing players to roll dice, manage combat, and automate character sheets directly in a Discord server. It supports **custom scripting (aliases)** that enhance its functionality by automating repetitive tasks and creating powerful macros.

## Features of This Repository
This repository includes a variety of Avrae aliases designed to improve gameplay efficiency.

- **Initiative Tracker**: Automatically rolls initiative for all combatants and sorts them in order.
- **Tool Check Macro**: Applies proficiency bonuses and automates skill checks.
- **Combat Macros**: Tracks conditions, spell effects, and other in-game modifiers.
- **Custom Roll Commands**: Streamlines common dice rolls with easy-to-use commands.

## Installation
To use these aliases in Avrae:

1. Open your Discord server with Avrae installed.
2. Type `!alias embed` followed by the alias name and the provided script.
3. Alternatively, you can use Avraeâ€™s web dashboard to add aliases under "Custom Aliases".
4. Test your alias by running the associated command in Discord.

### Example Usage
**Initiative Tracker:**
```
!init tracker
```
```
Goblin: 15
Fighter: 12
Cleric: 8
```

## Why I Built These Aliases
As a Dungeon Master and a programmer, I wanted to make my games run more smoothly by automating repetitive tasks. These aliases improve efficiency, reduce errors, and allow players to focus on the role-playing aspect of D&D rather than constant rule lookups.

This project showcases my ability to develop **custom automation tools**, work with scripting languages, and optimize workflows in a collaborative environment.
