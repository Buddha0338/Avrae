-desc "Crusades provde the GM the oppertunity to weave together a story for a select amount of players, allowing them to create a more immersive way to play.

**__Downtime__**
Players do not earn any downtime while on the crusade but instead, get a mass amount of downtime at the very end equal to the ranks relevant. 

**__Crusade Points (CP)__**
Game Masters and above earn crusade points for every quest they host to spend on hosting crusades, excluding the crusade itself. The higher ranked the crusade, the more CP is required. Each 4 hour quest hosted will earn 1 CP, for every 2 hours beyond that an additional CP is earned.

**__Running a Crusade__**
The CP Requirement table shows how much CP is needed to run a 2 game crusade for 5 players. 

A 6th player in a 2 game crusade will be 1 additional CP, similarly, a 6th player in 3 crusade games will be 2 additional CP.

**__CP Requirement Table__**
Bronze: 2
Silver: 3
Electrum: 4
Gold: 5
Platinum: 6

• Add 1 CP for each game beyond the second.
• Add 1 CP for each extra player beyond the 5th for each game. 

__Running a Crusade - Example__
Silver Crusade with 7 players and 4 games.
Base Cost: 3CP (Silver)
Two additional players: +2CP
Two additional games: +4CP (+1CP per additional player per game)
Total CP required: 9CP

**__Notes__**
Characters are locked in roleplay
Players in crusades have lower priority
Characters can't spend downtime (some exceptions)
